# encryption-decryption-system
This is a basic encoding decoding system using the java file handling concept

The App will be able to encrypt and decrypt the following categories:

1. STRING: For String, the user will need to Enter any String and the app will generate encrypted Data and generate a key.

2. FILE: For the File user will need to provide the File Path and also the Destination path and the app will generate an encrypted File and key So that the User can decrypt in the future.

3. IMAGE: For an Image user will need to provide the image path and type and App will generate an encrypted file and key. When the user decrypts the image then he can also change the type of the Image.
